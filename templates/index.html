    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
        This project is designed to help teachers detect plagiarism
        between student submissions in Google Classroom.
        Unlike traditional plagiarism checkers that compare content
        against the internet, this system focuses on peer-to-peer
        similarity — the most common form of copying in classrooms.
        <br><br>
        Built using Flask, Google Classroom API, Google Drive API,
        PDF text extraction, and machine learning techniques,
        this tool automates a time-consuming task for educators.
